This can largely\\nbe attributed to two causes.\\nFirst, the open source LLM ecosystem has grown remarkably, progressing from\\nopen source LLMs that lagged the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a wide margin to\\nnear-SOTA (e.g., Llama-2) LLMs that can be run on consumer laptops in ~1 year!\\nThe drivers of this progress include increasingly large corpus of training data\\n(x-axis, below) and fine-tuning (y-axis) for instruction-following and better-\\nhuman-aligned responses. Performant open source base models o\\x00er benefits\\nsuch as cost savings (e.g., for token-intensive tasks), privacy, and - with fine\\ntuning - the opportunity to exceed SOTA LLMs with much smaller open source for\\nhighly specific tasks.\\nSecond, the leading LLM provider, OpenAI, has released fine-tuning support for\\ngpt-3.5-turbo (and other models). Previously, fine-tuning was only available\\nfor older models. These models were not nearly as capable as newer models,\\nmeaning even a\\x00er fine-tuning, they o\\x00en weren't competitive with GPT-3.5 and\\nfew-shot examples. Now that newer models can be fine-tuned, many expect this\\nto change.\\nSome have argued that organizations may opt for many specialist fine-tuned\\nLLMs derived from open source base models over a single massive generalist\\nmodel.

This guide provides\\nan overview and shows how LangSmith can support the process.\\nWhen to fine-tune\\nLLMs can learn new knowledge in at least two ways: weight updates (e.g., pre-\\ntraining or fine-tuning) or prompting (e.g., retrieval augmented generation, RAG).\\nModel weights are like long-term memory whereas the prompt is like short-term\\nmemory. This OpenAI cookbook has a useful analogy: When you fine-tune a\\nmodel, it's like studying for an exam one week away. When you insert knowledge\\ninto the prompt (e.g., via retrieval), it's like taking an exam with open notes.\\nWith this in mind, fine-tuning is not advised for teaching an LLM new knowledge\\nor factual recall; this talk from John Schulman of OpenAI notes that fine-tuning\\ncan increase hallucinations. Fine-tuning is better suited for teaching specialized\\ntasks, but it sho uld be considered relative to prompting or RAG. As discussed\\nhere, fine-tuning can be helpful for well-defined tasks with ample examples and /\\nor LLMs that lack the in-context learning capacity for few-shot prompting. This\\nAnyscale blog summarizes these points well: fine-tuning is for form, not facts.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/langchain_docs.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='10/13/23, 2:00 PM Using LangSmith to Support Fine-tuning\\nhttps://blog.langchain.dev/using-langsmith-to-support-fine-tuning-of-open-source-llms/ 4/15How to fine-tune\\nThereʼs a number of helpful LLaMA fine-tuning recipes that have been released\\nfor tasks such as chat using a subset of the OpenAssistant corpus in\\nHuggingFace. Notably, these work on a single CoLab GPU, which makes the\\nworkflow accessible. However, two of the largest remaining pain points in fine-\\ntuning are dataset collection / cleaning and evaluation. Below we show how\\nLangSmith can be used to help address both of these (green, below).\\nTask\\nTasks like classification / tagging or extraction are well-suited for fine-tuning;\\nAnyscale reported promising results (exceeding GPT4) by fine-tuning LLaMA 7B\\nand 13B LLMs on extraction, text-to-SQL, and QA. As a test case, we chose\\nextraction of knowledge triples of the form (subject, relation, object) from text:\\nthe subject and object are entities and the relation is a property or connection\\nbetween them. Triples can then be used to build knowledge graphs, databases\\nthat store information about entities and their relationships. We built an public\\nStreamlit app for triple extraction from user input text to explore the capacity of\\nLLMs (GPT3.5 or 4) to extract triples with function calling. In parallel, we fine-\\ntuned LLaMA2-7b-chat and GPT-3.5 for this task using public datasets.'),\n",

LangSmith o\\x00ers a queryable\\ninterface so you can use user feedback filters, tags, and other metrics to select\\nfor poor quality cases, correct the outputs in the app, and save to datasets that\\nyou can use to improve the results of your model (see below).\\nAs an example, we created LangSmith train and test datasets from knowledge\\ngraph triples in the public BenchIE and CarbIE datasets; we converted them to a\\nshared JSON format with each triplet represented as {s: subject, object: object,\\nrelation: relationship} and randomly split the combined data to into a  train set of\\n~1500 labeled sentences and a test set of 100 sentences. The CoLab shows how\\nto easily load LangSmith datasets. Once loaded, we create instructions for fine-\\ntuning using the system prompt below and LLaMA instruction tokens (as done\\nhere):\\n\"you are a model tasked with extracting knowledge graph triples from \\n\"The triples consist of:\\\\n\"\\n\"- \\\\\"s\\\\\": the subject, which is the main entity the statement is abou'),\n",

We want to do this on a single GPU (HuggingFace guide here), which\\npresents a challenge: if each parameter is 32 bits, a 7B parameter LLaMA2 model\\nwill occupy 28GB, which exceeds the VRAM of a T4 (16GB). To address this, we\\nquantize the model parameters, which means binning the values (e.g., to 16\\nvalues in the case of 4 bit quantization), which reduces the memory required to\\nstore the model (7B * 4 bits / parameter =3.5GB) ~8-fold.\\nLoRA and qLoRA\\nWith the model in memory, we still need a way to fine-tune within the constraint\\nof the remaining GPU resources. For this, parameter-e\\x00icient fine-tuning (PEFT)\\nis a common approach: LoRA freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects\\ntrainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the model architecture\\n(see here), reducing the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning (e.g.,\\n~1% of the total model). qLoRA extends this by freezing quantized weights.\\nDuring fine-tuning frozen weights are de-quantized for forward and backward\\npasses, but only the (small set of) LoRA adapters are saved in memory, reducing\\nfine-tuned model footprint.\\nTraining'),\n",
